# Project-Facial-Recognition-with-Python
This project is an extension of the learning from the 1309102 Computer Programming course, focusing on creating a facial recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and deep learning techniques.
## System Requirements

- Python 3.7 or newer
- OpenCV 4.0 or newer

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/username/Facial-Recognition-with-Python.git
